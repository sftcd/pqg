# pqg

Proposed guidance on use pq algs for IETF

Possible changes for a -05:

- From ekr (sorta:-):

    - make 3.1 specific to x25519 & mlkem768

- From John M:

    > I think you intend to say that "pure" PQ KEMs is NOT RECOMMEND also
    > before it becomes practical to use hybrid KEMS.
    > 
    > groups is TLS specific. RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 and RSAES-OAEP should also
    > be disabled.

- From Rich S:

    - say that, when it exists, WG-specific guidance over-rides this generic 
      guidance
