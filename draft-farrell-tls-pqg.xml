    <section title="Introduction">

        <t>
            [[This is not an "official" TLS WG work item, but is being proposed
            as such. The source for this is in https://github.com/sftcd/pqg/
            PRs are welcome there too.]]
        </t>

        <t>
            Due to concerns about the possible future existence of a
            cryptographically
            relevant quantum computer (CRQC), additional TLS
            <xref target="RFC8446"/>
            codepoints
            have been defined for algorithms that are hoped to remain
            secure even in the face of a CRQC. Adding code-points for
            to the relevant IANA registries with the
            RECOMMENDED column set to 'n' doesn't require IETF consensus. This
            means that anyone can register code-points for their
            favoured approach. In particular various government
            entities in various countries have made contradictory
            recommendations in this space, leading to potential
            confusion for those deploying applilcations using TLS.
        </t>

        <t>This document sets out a deliberately consise sets of recommendations
        for typical uses of post-quantum algorithms. This assumes the reader is familiar
            with the topic.</t>

      <section title="Terminology">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
        "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
        14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only
        when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Start using hybrid KEMs">

          <t>The main recommendation is to move as soon as practical to use of
              hybrid KEMs, such as X25519MLKEM768.</t>

          <t>Once it becomes practical to do the above, we do not recommend use
              of non-hybrid groups.</t>

      </section>

      <section title="Do nothing for now on signatures">

          <t>We recommend taking no action at all at this point in time in
              relation to signatures.</t>
