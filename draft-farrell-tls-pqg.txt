1.  Introduction

   [[This is not an "official" work item anywhere, the -00 was proposed
   to TLS as such, but this version generalises to more than just TLS.
   This was discussed at the IETF-124 secdispatch session and the
   outcome was that further discussion should be on the general security
   area list. (saag@ietf.org) The source for this is in
   https://github.com/sftcd/pqg/ PRs are welcome there too.]]

   Due to concerns about the possible future existence of a
   cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC), a number of IETF
   working groups have defined ways in which post-quantum (PQ)
   cryptographic algorithms can be used with IETF protocols such as TLS,
   SSH, IPsec, OpenPGP and others and with the public key infrastructure
   (PKI) that supports a number of these protocols.  Implementers have
   also made headway in incorporating these changes into sometimes
   widely used implementations.

   However, once supported by implementations, these changes support
   many different configurations so those deploying post-quantum
   algorithms now can be faced with an overly-broad set of choices, some
   of which might lead to worse interoperability or even lesser security
   than others.  This document provides current guidance on a very high-
   level set of deployment choices that are recommended for use today.

   It is reasonably likely that this guidance will change in the not-too
   distant future, as post-quantum support in protocols and
   implementations matures, so this document may well be updated in the
   relatively near future.

Internet-Draft             Current PQ Guidance             December 2025


   The format of this document is to provide very concise guidance in
   Section 3, and follow that with background material.  A reader
   pressed for time may be able to stop reading at the end of Section 3.
   Some more specialised implementations and environments may have to
   meet other requirements that conflict with this guidance - in such
   cases those deploying will need to do more research in order to
   select good options.  More detailed background is provided in
   [RFC9794] and [I-D.ietf-pquip-pqc-engineers].

   The audience for this document are those deploying systems now.  This
   guidance is not aimed at those developing IETF protocols, nor
   implementations of those.  Given that it seems that the latter groups
   (protocol developers and implementers) seem determined to define and
   implement almost every possible combination of PQ everything, those
   deploying systems now, that have such PQ all kinds of everything, can
   benefit from simple guidance that addresses the most important aspect
   of the PQ transition.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Recommendations

3.1.  Start using hybrid KEMs

   We RECOMMEND moving as soon as practical to use of PQ/T hybrid Key
   Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs).

   Once it becomes practical to use hybrid KEMs, such as X25519MLKEM768
   for TLS, we do NOT RECOMMEND use of non-hybrid/classic groups or
   "pure" PQ KEMs.

3.2.  Do nothing for now on signatures

   For almost all deployments, we RECOMMEND taking no action at all at
   this point in time in relation to deployment of PQ signatures.

4.  Background and Justifications

   Many additional IANA codepoints (dozens) have been defined by IETF
   working groups for algorithms that are hoped to remain secure even in
   the face of a CRQC.  Adding code-points to some relevant IANA
   registries doesn't require IETF consensus.  This means that, in such
   case, anyone can register code-points for their favoured approach,
   typically so long as there is some specification for the algorithm
   concerned.  For example, anyone can register a PQ algorithm in the
   TLS named group registry with the RECOMMENDED column set to 'n'

   Various government entities in different countries have made
   contradictory recommendations in this space, leading to potential
   confusion for those deploying applications using PQ algorithms.

   Hybrid KEMs are combinations of two or more KEMs with the goal of
   providing security as long as one of the component KEMs is able to
   provide security.  Hybrid KEMs therefore typically consist of a
   newer, presumed post-quantum secure KEM (such as ML-KEM), to guard
   against attacks by a CRQC, as well as an established traditional KEM
   (such as variations of ECDH-KEM), to guard against rapid
   cryptanalysis of the post-quantum KEM.

   Any reasonable Hybrid KEM construction provides greater security
   guarantees than single KEMs, but they may differ in the exact
   scenarios in which they provide such guarantees (e.g. only
   cryptanalysis against one KEM vs.  some implementation faults in one
   KEM) and in how they are used in specific protocols.  Generally, the
   IETF WG responsible for a specific protocol will have done the
   analysis as to how to safely incorporate hybrid KEMs.

   Whereas key establishment needs to guard against passive attacks,
   which may be conducted long after online communication has taken
   place (i.e. harvest now, decrypt later attacks), signatures are
   typically only required to guard against active attacks.  Therefore,
   a traditional signature scheme can secure protocols for as long as
   CRQCs do not exist.

   Systems dealing with signatures that are required to still be
   usefully verifiable in the timeframe that might include a CRQC are
   rare and complex and are not further considered here.  Systems that
   need to select a signature verification public key (and hence
   algorithm) now, for use in some years time, are also not covered by
   this guidance.

5.  Security Considerations

   As we transition from RSA and ECC based algorithms to newer
   approaches, we will necessarily gather implementation experience and
   learn from failures.  Those deploying such systems are therefore
   advised to regularly monitor cryptanalytic advancements as well as
   attacks against natural implementations of newer schemes, and guard
   against failures using hybrid constructions such as the ones
   indicated above.
