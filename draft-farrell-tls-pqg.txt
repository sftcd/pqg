1.  Introduction

   [[This is not an "official" TLS WG work item, but is being proposed
   as such.  The source for this is in https://github.com/sftcd/pqg/ PRs
   are welcome there too.]]

   Due to concerns about the possible future existence of a
   cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC), additional TLS
   [RFC8446] codepoints have been defined for algorithms that are hoped
   to remain secure even in the face of a CRQC.  Adding code-points for
   to the relevant IANA registries with the RECOMMENDED column set to
   'n' doesn't require IETF consensus.  This means that anyone can
   register code-points for their favoured approach.  In particular
   various government entities in various countries have made
   contradictory recommendations in this space, leading to potential
   confusion for those deploying applilcations using TLS.

   This document sets out a deliberately consise sets of recommendations
   for typical uses of post-quantum algorithms.  This assumes the reader
   is familiar with the topic.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Start using hybrid KEMs

   The main recommendation is to move as soon as practical to use of
   hybrid KEMs, such as X25519MLKEM768.

   Once it becomes practical to do the above, we do not recommend use of
   non-hybrid groups.

4.  Do nothing for now on signatures

   We recommend taking no action at all at this point in time in
   relation to signatures.

5.  Security Considerations

   TBD

6.  Acknowledgements

   TBD

7.  IANA Considerations

   TBD, but probably not needed.
